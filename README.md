# Road Accident Data Analysis-Dashboard (In Excel)

## Problem Statement

Road accidents are a significant public safety concern, resulting in numerous casualties across different severity levels. This dashboard aims to analyze road accident data to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to accidents, with the ultimate goal of informing targeted safety measures and reducing casualties.

### Steps followed 

Data Import and Preparation:

Import the raw data into Excel
Clean and format the data, ensuring consistency in date formats, categories, etc.

Create Pivot Tables:
For casualty types (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
For vehicle types
For road types and surfaces
For location (Urban vs Rural)
For light conditions

Calculate Total Casualties:
Sum all casualty types

Create Charts:
Pie charts for casualty types, location, light conditions
Bar charts for road types and vehicle types
Line chart for monthly trend comparison

Add Slicers:
For year, urban/rural filter
Format Dashboard:

Apply dark theme
Arrange charts and tables logically

Add Conditional Formatting:
To highlight significant changes or concerning metrics

Insights from the Dashboard:

Casualty Severity:
Slight casualties are most common (84.7%), followed by serious (13.8%), and fatal (1.5%)
Total casualties: 417,883

Vehicle Types:
Cars are involved in the majority of casualties (155,804)
Significant involvement of bicycles (15,579) and buses (6,573)

Monthly Trends:
2022 shows lower casualty numbers compared to 2021 for most months
Both years show similar seasonal patterns

Road Types:
Single carriageway roads have the highest casualties (144.7K)
Roundabouts and slip roads have relatively lower casualties

Road Surface:
Dry surfaces account for most casualties (131,976)
Wet surfaces also significant (50,541)

Urban vs Rural:
Urban areas have more casualties (121.3K) compared to rural areas (74.5K)

Light Conditions:
More accidents occur in daylight (144.5K) than in dark conditions (51.2K)

Car-related Casualties:
89.3% of casualties involve cars

These insights can help prioritize safety measures, such as:
Focusing on urban road safety
Improving car safety features and driver education
Enhancing road conditions, especially on single carriageways
Addressing factors contributing to slight casualties to prevent escalation
Investigating the reasons for the decrease in casualties from 2021 to 2022 to reinforce effective measures
